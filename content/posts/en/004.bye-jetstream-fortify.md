We are all very excited about the arrival of [Laravel 12](laravel-12) and the upcoming features that will be added as the year progresses.
The Laravel team surprised us with new Starter Kits to integrate Livewire, Vue, and React into our projects with just a few commands. And, of course, Taylor Otwell made a great contribution with [AuthKit using WorkOS](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#workos).

I’ve tried WorkOS, and honestly, its use is quite simple, easy to understand, and implement, as long as you don’t exceed the 1,000,000 logins that [WorkOS allows](https://workos.com/pricing).

Many developers openly complained that the direction Laravel is taking is increasingly leaning towards paid tools. I don’t see this as a bad thing; after all, those who contribute to the framework should receive a return on their efforts.

With the arrival of this new AuthKit, in the release notes for this new version, we can find this subtle note:

With the introduction of our new starter kits, Laravel Breeze and Laravel Jetstream will no longer receive additional updates.

So, does this mean the end of these excellent tools?

Not necessarily. For now, the documentation for [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/introduction.html) and [Laravel Fortify](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/fortify) does not include any warnings about discontinuing support. Additionally:

The [Jetstream](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream/releases/tag/v5.3.5) 5.3.6 version added support for Laravel 12.

The [Fortify 1.25.4](https://github.com/laravel/fortify/releases/tag/v1.25.4) version added support for Laravel 12.

For now, it seems that the Laravel team will continue to maintain and possibly provide security fixes for these packages. However, if the community ends up embracing WorkOS positively, it’s likely that these repositories will eventually be archived. That said, these packages will no longer receive new features—they will only maintain and ensure that what’s already there works.

And you, what do you think about the direction Laravel is taking?
